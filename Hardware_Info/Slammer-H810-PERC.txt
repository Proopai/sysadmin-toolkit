Slammer Info:
 - Manufacturer: DELL
 - Model: MD1000
Raid Card:
 - Manufacturer: DELL
 - Model: PowerEdge PERC H810 Internal/External
 - Interface: PCIe 2.0
 - Flashed into IT/Passthrough Mode
Slammer Supports: SAS or SATA Drives
 - Recommended to use only Enterprise Grade Drives (even Refurbished ones outside of MFG Warranty period)
Slammer Backplane will limit to 6gbps per lane SAS-2 /SATA-III even if Drives are SAS-3 whose normal speed is 12Gbps
 - Drives will negotiate down to the slower speeds
 - Can Negotiate Down to SAS-1 / SATA-I Speeds if drives do not support higher.
H810 Controller Card is also limited to SAS-2/SATA-III (6gbps per lane)
In passthrough mode, Size of Disks is not limited except by Max (Spin-up) Power Utilization (240W Max)
 - Except Slammer JBOD does not spin up all drives at the same time, it staggers spinup
 - SAS Drives typically handle power issues better, but do require a little more power 1-3W extra per drive for active use (3-5W extra for spin up)
With ZFS, Recommended to Cap ZFS ARC Memory to 50% of System Memory
 - If Memory is needed by System or LXC/VMs ZFS ARC will release it. ARC is Low Priority but can and will use up to MAX Limit set when nothing else needs it.
 - ARC Memory can be limited to any value you specify (for example the below command sets it to 96GB)
   - echo "options zfs zfs_arc_max=$((96 * 1024**3))" > /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf
   - Follwup with a Reboot of the Node
 - Datasets within Pools are recommended to be configured, in the event you need to copy a dataset (such as Plex Media) to another Pool
   - can be accomplished using zfs snapshot and zfs send | zfs receive commands for onetime copies or tools like "zrepl" to setup automated syncs
   - Media DataSets such as Plex Media Files can have primarycache setting set to metadata instead of all, reduces how much is cached in ZFS ARC Memory.
   - VM Datasets should be configured with primarycache set to all and is recommended
   - primarycache setting is set with the following command
     - [Pool Level] zfs set primarycache=(all|metadata) PoolName
     - [DataSet Level] zfs set primarycache=(all|metadata) PoolName/DataSetName
